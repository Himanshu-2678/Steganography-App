# Description of the Project
Hey there, this is my first project. I made it using Tkinter, a GUI library of Python. This project i made is just for fun.
I made it so that those who want to share some secret message to someone, they can do it without any fear to be seen. <br>
[ P.S -> can be useful for couples, especially if there is high family restrictions ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£. ]
<h2>What is Steganography App?</h2>
